===========
For this project you need:
	- this project (obviously)
	- derby db (the version shouldn't be a problem)

Set up Derby DB:
Extract the derby zip wherever you want.
Go inside the "bin" folder and run "startNetworkServer".

Set up the program:
If derby is running in the same machine where you'll use this program, you're ready
	to go.
If not, open the program. When you get the error, click the "Configure..." button and
	insert the IP address/hostname of the server. Confirm and restart the program.
	Everything should run just fine from now on.
	
Enjoy!
